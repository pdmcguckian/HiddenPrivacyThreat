Modern sensing and wireless networking technology have led to rising adoption of consumer smart home devices. While these devices have the potential to provide users with convenience and utility – there is q growing fear that they are impacting our personal privacy.

The continuous and linkable nature of smart home data gives it an unparalleled potential to infer sensitive user information. Despite privacy being a fundamental human right, service providers continue to build their business models around surveillance capitalism – with companies like Alphabet already using user data for targeted advertising.

Professor Zuboff’s book The Age of Surveillance Capitalism vividly highlights the potential consequences of this – suggesting that opting into these data collecting services means we are opting out of our personal agency. Despite studies showing that individual’s place a clear monitory value on their privacy, adoption of these products and services continues to grow. Some have accounted this to the so called ‘privacy-paradox’, the phenomena of individuals placing a high value over their privacy, but frequently engaging in activities to damage it. 

However, Professor Solove debunked this myth - highlighting that the vast complexity of managing privacy leads individuals to make privacy decisions that conflict with their internal beliefs. Studies have found that consumers struggle to identify the risks associated with non-audio/video smart home products like smart lights – despite the fact they can be used to predict the kind of sensitive information like sleep schedules that they wish to keep private. 

The aim of my Master’s thesis is to develop a holistic platform to detect and mitigate privacy threats on a home network – and the intention is to commercialise my concept. However, when I discuss my work with typical consumers, it always takes time to convince them of the risks of sensitive information inference by non-AV devices. 

Therefore, for this Sensing and IoT project, I create a resource to vividly highlight the privacy risks of smart home devices by demonstrating their ability to infer sensitive user information.
